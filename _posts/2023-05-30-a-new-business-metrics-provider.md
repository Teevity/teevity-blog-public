We are thrilled to announce that we have added a new provider for our budget metrics feature, which is a key component of our FinOps platform. Budget metrics allow you to measure and optimize your cloud spending based on your business activity.

But why is this important? Because it helps you understand and improve your cloud unit economics, which is one of the most important concepts in FinOps. Cloud unit economics is a system of profit maximization based on objective measurements of how well your organization is performing against not only its FinOps goals, but as a business overall. By calculating the difference between your marginal cost (the cost of delivering one unit of your product or service) and your marginal revenue (the revenue generated by one unit of your product or service), you can determine where your cloud operations break even and begin to generate a profit.

With our budget metrics feature, you can easily calculate your cloud unit costs for any metric that matters to your business, such as revenue, users, transactions, or seats. You can also compare your cloud unit costs with your cloud unit revenue and see how they change over time. This way, you can identify opportunities to reduce waste, increase efficiency, and optimize performance.

Our new provider makes it even easier to integrate your budget metrics with any usage data found in your cloud provider billing information. You can also customize your dashboards and reports to suit your needs and preferences.

We believe that budget metrics are a powerful tool for achieving better outcomes for your cloud strategy and your business overall. That's why we are constantly working to improve our feature and add new providers to support more data sources and use cases. We hope you enjoy our new provider and we look forward to hearing your feedback.

## Cloud usage data as business metrics in action

Here’s an example of usage information found in the cloud billing data that can be leveraged as a proxy of the business activity.

It’s normal that your cloud spends are going to increase over time but it should match your company's overall business trend. This is not to say that you are not going to do regular optimizations like rightsizing or workload management to decrease your cloud provider bill but here we are looking at a longer term. 

In the [Teevity Dynamic Cost Explorer](https://docs.teevity.com/configuration/saas-teevity-cloud-cost-analytics/reports-for-your-cloud-costs-analytics) you can build a report of your cloud egress traffic. This report is going to be used as a proxy of the business trend, a pulse if you want.

After configuring this report as the source of business data as [described](https://docs.teevity.com/configuration/saas-teevity-cloud-cost-analytics/configuration-of-business-metrics-definitions#h.vnidhdyh5nm3) in our documentation, you can use it in your cloud cost [exploration](https://docs.teevity.com/configuration/saas-teevity-cloud-cost-analytics/configuration-of-business-metrics-definitions#h.ul9o38xs12yq) . 

The chart at the top is the absolute cloud spend by product. Below is the same information but relative to the business unit trend.

For each product you can see the spend per unit (here we use a factor of 1024 to get the cost by GB of network traffic). In this particular example we can observe a healthy trend because, even if the absolute cost of cloud spend is increasing, the relative cost by business unit is decreasing.
